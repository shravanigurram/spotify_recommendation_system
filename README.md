- **Genre-based Recommendations**: Discover songs from a specific genre.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web app framework for the interface.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for the KNN algorithm.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Data handling and processing.
- **Pickle**: Loading pre-trained model and data.

## Getting Started
